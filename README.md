# Study Time

A new Flutter project as a part of Task Phase for Manipal The Talk Network - Dev

## Problem Statement

You will be building a Study Material Bank which hosts all study material (in form of pdfs) of all branches and semesters. For the sake of simplicity, we expect you guys to have at least the following data:
- Computer science and engineering
    - Semester 3:
        - Any 3 mock pdfs
    - Semester 4:
        - Any 3 mock pdfs
- Electrical and electronics engineering
    - Semester 5
        - Any 3 mock pdfs
    - Semester 6
        - Any 3 mock pdfs

### IMPORTANT POINTERS:
You have the liberty to choose either of the tracks listed below:
-  build the Front-end client, be it
    - android app (flutter/java/kotlin)
    - iOS app (swift/flutter)
    - Website (React.js)
- Should follow good UI/UX practices
-  We are not looking for something really good or an amazing UI. It should be functional that's all.

OR

Build the Backend of the study material bank with the framework and database of your choice example: NodeJs, Flask, Django, MySql, Mongodb etc
- Should have well defined routes i.e <stream>/<subject>/<semester>/xyz.pdf
- Should be a viable solution
- Should serve pdfs whenever requested
- Should have admin routes (Bonus)
    - Admins can add/remove the branches/subjects/semesters/pdfs
- Host your API (bonus)



Deadline - 12:00 PM, 28th November

Submission Method: Create a public Github repository and push your code there. You will be required to send the repository link as the final submission with working demo of your app/website in the Readme.md. People working on the backend track and put PostMan or browser screenshots containing request and response bodies in the Readme.md file

Feel free to contact any of the group admins or put up a message on the group, we are here to help. We are NOT looking for a finished product, we will be looking at how you approach the problem statement.

Wishing y’all the best of luck!✨
